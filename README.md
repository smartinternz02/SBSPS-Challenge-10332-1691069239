Identifying Patterns and Trends in Campus Placement Data using Machine Learning

We used RandomForestClassifier to predict whether the student is placed or not, if the student is placed we used linear regression to predict the salary of the student. 
We deployed our ML model in IBM Cloud, and to do that we used IBM's ML service and IBM Watson studio.
To take input from users we created a html UI and integrated it with our ML model using Flask WebFramework.
